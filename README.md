# Mailspring Nord Theme

This is my attempt at a Nord theme for Mailspring. Work in progress. Based on the [Nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) color scheme.

## Install

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. In mailspring: `Edit -> Install Theme -> Mailspring-Theme-Nord`.

## Known Issues

- When viewing some emails the text may be dark and hard to read. I'm trying to figure this out, but it seems that it happens with other user made dark themes as well. See [https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter/issues/5](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter/issues/5).
