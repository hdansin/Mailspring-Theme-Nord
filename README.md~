# Mailspring Theme Starter

This is my attempt at a Nord theme for Mailspring. Work in progress.

## Install

1. Download or clone this repository.

2. In mailspring: `Edit -> Install Theme -> Choose this folder`.

## Known Issues

- When viewing messages the text may be dark and hard to read. I'm trying to figure this out, but it seems it happens to other user made dark themes as well. See [https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter/issues/5](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter/issues/5).
